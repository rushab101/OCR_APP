# Optical Character Recognition App
## Description
An app that I have made using Android Studio and Java.

## How it works
Once the app detects any kind of character it shows it on the left hand side of the screen. You can see from the screenshots below 
 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img align="left" src="https://imgur.com/a.jpg/D0EHJgA"></th>
      <th><img align="right" src="https://imgur.com/5zvxRQS"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
